# ðŸ›’ Express

Express was an online billing platform for an unpaying client. 

This client would charge a monthly fee for access to a discord server, which this web application would monitor.

It would also allow users access to a certain page, containing details on purchasing products, via a password.

This is mostly complete, however there are bugs in relation to the billing process which have not been fully ironed out and no test written.
